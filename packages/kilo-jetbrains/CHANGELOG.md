## [7.0.12-rc.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

### Fixed

- Fix the GitHub-hosted bundled JetBrains plugin build so signing uses certificate and private-key files during verification.

### Changed

## [7.0.12-rc.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Support sending another JetBrains prompt while a session is still running. Queued prompts now appear in the conversation and can be removed before Kilo starts processing them.

### Added

- Add a signed GitHub-hosted bundled JetBrains plugin build that includes the Kilo CLI for offline or restricted-network installs.

### Fixed

- Load global skills reliably from JetBrains projects that are not inside a Git repository.
- Support adaptive thinking for Claude Opus and Sonnet 5+ model identifiers across Anthropic, AI Gateway, and Bedrock providers.
- Flush pending cloud session updates when the Kilo Core runtime shuts down, reducing cases where the final assistant message is missing when a session is reopened elsewhere.
- Prune stale bundled CLI versions after upgrading bundled JetBrains installs.

### Changed

- Update the JetBrains CLI pin from Kilo Core 7.4.15 to 7.4.16.

## [7.0.10] - 2026-07-24

## [7.0.10] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Render edit, write, and apply-patch tool results as expandable diff previews with clickable file links, change counts, syntax-highlighted diffs, and clearer multi-file patch sections.

### Fixed

- Improve session performance for large transcripts.
- Fix Kilo Core failures caused by strict OpenAI-compatible compaction requests, unexpected provider finish reasons, read-only database files at startup, AWS profile credentials, and config files being rewritten just by reading them.

### Changed

- Update the JetBrains CLI pin from Kilo Core 7.4.13 to 7.4.15.

## [7.0.9] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Add a Rules settings page under Agent Behavior for managing instruction files and Claude Code compatibility.

### Fixed

- Restore importing cloud-only session history by updating the JetBrains CLI pin to Kilo Core 7.4.13.

### Added

- Add settings for context controls, including context mentions and ignore patterns.
- Add settings for skills, including editing local skills and viewing remote skills as read-only.

## [7.0.7] - 2026-07-15

### Added

### Fixed

- Improve custom provider setup by validating required fields and showing configuration errors in the dialog.
- Close the custom provider dialog correctly after adding a provider.
- Clean up deleted custom providers by using the disconnect flow.

### Changed

- Keep the JetBrains plugin pinned to Kilo Core 7.4.5 for this release.

## [7.0.6] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Honor the IDE's certificate and proxy settings for outbound HTTPS requests.

## [7.0.5] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Add an elapsed-time indicator to the session progress footer so long-running tasks show how long they have been active.
- Support importing legacy JetBrains v5 data directly from raw storage when the previous consolidated migration file is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Restore the v5 migration wizard for users whose legacy provider, OAuth, MCP, mode, setting, or session data was not detected during upgrade.
- Improve migration reliability by preserving checklist todos, importing legacy tool calls as assistant parts, validating raw session IDs, and reducing migration memory usage.
- Polish session controls with more native prompt icons, progress footer spacing, auto-hiding prompt scrollbars, and improved rollback/redo scrolling.

### Changed

- Keep the JetBrains plugin pinned to Kilo Core 7.4.5 for this release.

## [7.0.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Stop orphaned Kilo Core processes on Windows so closing the IDE no longer leaves a lingering `kilo serve` process or blocks the next IDE launch.

### Added

- Add Kilo Core support for localized commit-message generation, AI image generation, large bash-output pruning, and improved model-usage display.

### Fixed

- Fix workspace reload recovery so stale reload state no longer disrupts the session connection.
- Fix JetBrains rollback and revert flows so prompt focus, scroll state, diff order, and turn state are preserved more reliably.
- Fix Kilo Core Bedrock SSO credential resolution and commit-message error handling when no changes are available.
